                The common assumption concerning what constitutes a Surrealist image is the notion that the properties that make up a photograph can tell the observer whether it belongs to this category, disregarding the historical context involving surrealism.   

Properties meaning sign systems, where the meaning overrides the type of picture and what visual elements we see. The confusion or inconsistency of what we are used to seeing in connection to signifier-signified meanings is one approach to determine whether an image is 'surreal'. When the message suggests an 'enigma', for instance. “An enigma, . . . is proposed to the subject by another subject. . . . [It] can only be proposed by someone who does not master the answer, because his message is a compromise-formation in which his unconscious takes part.” 1  

Surrealism first originated as a movement in Paris in 1924. Where a group of young Frenchmen led by the poet André Breton experimented with new artistic forms after being greatly influenced by Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis. It was an avant-garde movement which, like Dada, rebelled against the corrupt, hypocritical society responsible for sending millions to their death in the First World War. They aimed to access the unconscious parts of the mind and reveal one's true nature by practicing automatic writing and drawing. Some even engaged in hypnosis and drug use in their quest to uncover the mysteries of the human psyche.  

A somewhat connected group of Surrealist authors and artists met at The Bureau of Surrealist Research in Paris to collaborate, have discussions, and conduct interviews in an effort to "gather all the information possible related to forms that might express the unconscious activity of the mind." It opened on October 11th, 1924, under the direction of Antonin Artaud, just four days before André Breton's first Surrealist Manifesto was published, at 15 Rue de Grenelle (see Figure 1).

                When analyzing ‘Surrealist’ artwork, specifically within photographic practices we ask ourselves: Is it categorized as such because it is used within surrealism, or does it contain particular elements and characteristics which recognize it as being ‘surreal’? The most prevalent assumption is the latter. This will be demonstrated in the analysis of the following photographs.   

   

Consisting primarily of strange and dreamlike imagery, Surrealism seeks to depict unconsciousness as a vivid reality. It also focuses on symbolism; As an example of this, we can look at Salvador Dali's ‘Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee around a Pomegranate a Second before Waking’ from 1944 (see Figure 2). It depicts his wife Gala laying on a rock while being surrounded by an elephant, pomegranate, fish, rifle, and two tigers. This kind of art featured an absurd variety of objects with symbolic meanings, many of which had suggestive sexual connotations.  He was one of the most influential Surrealists because of his belief that images could be interpreted in many different ways (based on Freudian theories).

    </div>
    <div style="padding-bottom:2vh">
            
        In Maurice Tabard’s ‘Hand and Woman’ (Main et femme), 1929 (see Figure. 5) we see various comparisons to Brassaï’s piece. It is a black-and-white double-exposure photograph composed of a male and female figure, where the female is the main focus but somehow the male presence is far more dominating. Premeditation is evident in Tabard’s complex and layered work, and everything seems to have symbolic meaning. The woman is wearing a white dress which could signify purity as she holds a hand mirror in a way that covers her face while the shady, faceless male presence reaches his hand out as if to grab her. This could relate to the fear of death.   

So, what makes this photograph fall into the category of ‘Surrealism’? According to David Bate in What is a surrealist photograph? images where the signified is not clear and where reality is no longer mimetic will be considered an ‘enigmatic’ photograph. For this, the photographer will use techniques such as darkroom manipulation, collage making or camera skills to achieve this surreal effect.
